I am currently an assistant professor in the [Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science](https://medicine.iu.edu/biostatistics) at Indiana University School of Medicine.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Emory University, under the supervision of [Dr. Amita Manatunga](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=amita-manatunga-36), [Dr. Limin Peng](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=limin-peng-338) and [Dr. Ying Guo](https://www.yingguo.us/).
My research interests include:
- high-dimensional [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) data analysis with application to multimodal neuroimaging data,
- joint analysis of intermittently observed longitudinal data and complex time-to-event data, including right-censored and interval-censored survival data, and panel count data,
- statistical analysis for mental health studies, criminology and clinical trials.
 <!-- (collaborated with [Dr. Lin Liu](https://lindyliu0.wixsite.com/linliu/publications) at [FIU](https://www.fiu.edu/)) and clinical trials. -->



I obtained my Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Missouri, advised by [Dr. Jianguo (Tony) Sun](https://sunj.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/). I earned my [M.Phil.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy) in statistics from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Dr. Xingqiu Zhao](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-zhao-xingqiu/) and Dr. Zhisheng Ye, and a Bachelor of Science from the same institution. 

## I am looking for potential doctoral students with strong quantitative and computing skills.
