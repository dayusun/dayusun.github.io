I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Emory University, under the supervsion of [Dr. Amita Manatunga](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=amita-manatunga-36), [Dr. Limin Peng](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=limin-peng-338) and [Dr. Ying Guo](https://www.yingguo.us/).
My research interests include:
- high-dimensional [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) data analysis with application to multimodal neuroimaging data,
- joint analysis of complex time-to-event data and intermittently observed longitudinal data,
- statistical analysis for mental health studies, criminology (collaborated with [Dr. Lin Liu](https://lindyliu0.wixsite.com/linliu/publications) at [FIU](https://www.fiu.edu/)) and clinical trials.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Missouri, advised by [Dr. Jianguo (Tony) Sun](https://sunj.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/); and earned my [M.Phil.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Philosophy) in statistics from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by Dr. Xingqiu Zhao and Dr. Zhisheng Ye.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
